        <h2>Is Amana.app Legit or a Scam? 🤔</h2>
        <p>Amana.app, formerly known as Amana Capital, has been accused of being a scam by numerous traders and victims. Many users report difficulties withdrawing their funds, and the broker has been labeled as a market maker, meaning they trade against their clients. This unethical practice, combined with excessive slippage, makes Amana.app a risky choice for traders.</p>

        <h2>Negative Reviews and Complaints 📉</h2>
        <p>There are countless negative reviews online from traders who have struggled with Amana.app. Common complaints include:</p>

            <li>🚫 Accusations of market manipulation</li>
            <li>🚫 Misleading licensing claims (DFSA and Lebanon Forex Trading Retail License)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Licensing Issues and Name Change 🕵️‍♂️</h2>
        <p>Amana.app claims to hold a DFSA license and a Lebanon Forex Trading Retail License. However, these licenses have done little to protect traders from the broker's unethical practices. In fact, the broker changed its name from Amana Capital to Amana.app, possibly to mislead traders and distance itself from its negative reputation.</p>

        <p>Based on the overwhelming number of complaints and the broker's questionable practices, it is clear that Amana.app is not a trustworthy broker. Traders should avoid this platform to protect their investments.</p>
